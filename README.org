This project is concerned with the implementation of two different Gibbs samplers for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

Gibbs samplers are clustering algorithms that assume and exploit the
distribution assumptions of the clusters (GMM). It thus is more sophisticated than
K-mean-clustering algorithm. Gibbs samplers are often used in the text
clustering and summary applications.
